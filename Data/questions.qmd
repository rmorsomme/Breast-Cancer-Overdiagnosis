## Data Overview

Two data sets

-   participants ($n=106,817$)

-   screens ($n=540,322$)

. . .

We have a list of 9 questions, roughly in order of importance.

## Q1 -- unknown / other mode of detection among women with breast cancer

![](images/count_detec.png){width="174"}

![](images/detec.png){width="508"}
:::

632+756=**1388** women with breast cancer (`endpoint=1`) have a detection mode that is either *other* or *unknown*.

## Q1bis -- Gaining information about the mode of detection

The mode of detection is a key variable for women with cancer.

Can you think of any way to gain more information on the `detec` field from the cancer registry?

Removing **1388 out of 4545** women with breast cancer would lead to serious bias.

## Q3 -- High proportion of *clinical* cancer

::: {layout-ncol="2"}
![](images/count_detec.png){width="174"}

![](images/detec.png){width="509"}
:::

Among the 4545 cancers, 906 (**20%**) are coded as clinical.

This is more than expected; in the US, it is only about 20%.

## Q4 -- Few BI-RADS of 4, 5

While there are **4545** cancers, there are only 693+1545=**2238** screens with BI-RADS of 4 or 5.

::: {layout-ncol="2"}
![](images/count_concl.png){width="180"}

![](images/concl.png){width="259"}
:::

In Swiss practice, is it common for women with final BI-RADS finding of `concl=3` to get a biopsy?

## Q5 -- Many clinical cancer diagnosed shortly after in-program screen

![](images/delta.jpeg)

Is it a coincidence that many women were diagnosed as clinical right after their last screen?

## Example -- 15 days between last screen and endpointdt

![](images/delta_eg.png)

## Q6 -- Non-missing BI-RADS for screens not attended?

::: {layout-ncol="2"}
![](images/count_nopartreas.png){width="240"}

![](images/nopartreas_concl.png){width="427"}
:::

Shouldn't BI-RADS be missing (`concl=9`) when participants did not attend the screen (`nopartreas=1,2,3`)?

## Q7 -- No positive screen for screen-detected cancers

![](images/bi_rads.jpeg){fig-align="center" width="399"}

![](images/bi_rads_eg.jpeg.png)

## Q8 -- Screens after endpointdt

![](images/delta_negative.png)

## Q9 -- Some dates have a large number of censor dates

![](images/count_endpointdt.png){fig-align="center" width="220"}

For instance, 1612 women were censored on May 14, 2018.
